# Witch's Journey Character Data
[English](README.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

Returns data on characters from the The Journey of Elaina (魔女の旅々). I'd like to implement it like an API using repl.it in the future.

## FEATURE
This program collects data from a spreadsheet The data is encoded into a json file and displayed like api.
I am planning to make the API available to everyone by using repl.it in the future.

***
## Note
This is the point I stumbled upon in writing Go: 
- When encoding from struct to json, the first letter of the variable name must be capitalized
